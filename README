For the non-preemptive kernel, we mostly followed the prescribed methods. Our
scheduler implements scheduler_entry by storing all registers on the stack that
is assosciated with the currently running task, saving the stack pointer in the
PCB of the currently running task, then calling scheduler() which dequeues the
next element of the ready queue into currently_running.
